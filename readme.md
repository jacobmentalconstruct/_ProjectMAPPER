## Features

* **Interactive Project Tree:** Visualize your project's folder structure. Interactively check or uncheck folders to include or exclude them from all operations.
* **Generate Text Maps:** Create a clean text file that maps out the directory and file structure of all selected items.
* **Dump Source Code:** Concatenate the contents of all selected text-based files into a single, comprehensive `.txt` file for easy review or sharing.
* **System & Environment Audits:**
    * **System Info:** Log details about your OS, Python version, and installed packages (`pip freeze`).
    * **Conda Environments:** List all available Conda environments and audit the packages within a selected environment.
* **Project Backup:** Create a compressed `.tar.gz` archive of all selected files and folders‚Äîperfect for creating a snapshot of your work.
* **Configuration persistence:** The tool saves your folder selections and custom file exclusions for each project, so your setup is remembered next time you run it.
* **No Installation Needed:** Runs on any system with a standard Python 3 installation.
